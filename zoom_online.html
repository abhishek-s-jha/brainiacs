    <td> And Chapoba, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, District Director. And there's one final thing to be done, and that is to announce the best table topic speaker. And notice that I did not share the poll of the best table topic speaker, because if you do that, then it doesn't have that same feeling of a toast.</td>

So the Toastmaster of the day, because I ran the poll, it is my privilege then to announce the best table topic speaker. In this case, of course, the best speaker was only one.</td>
